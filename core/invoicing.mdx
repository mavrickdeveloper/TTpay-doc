# Invoicing

TTpay provides comprehensive invoicing functionality, allowing you to create, manage, and generate PDF invoices. This document explains how to use the invoicing features of the package.

## Invoice Model

The `Invoice` model represents an invoice in the system:

```php
namespace Mavrickdeveloper\Ttpay\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany;

class Invoice extends Model
{
    // Properties and methods
}
```

### Key Fields

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `number`: Invoice number
- `date`: Invoice issue date
- `due_date`: Payment due date
- `customer_name`: Customer name
- `customer_email`: Customer email
- `customer_address`: Customer address
- `status`: Invoice status (draft, sent, paid, etc.)
- `total`: Total invoice amount
- `currency`: Currency code
- `notes`: Additional notes

## Creating Invoices

### From an Order

The most common way to create an invoice is from an existing order:

```php
use Mavrickdeveloper\Ttpay\Services\InvoiceService;
use Mavrickdeveloper\Ttpay\Models\Order;

public function generateInvoice(InvoiceService $invoiceService, $orderId)
{
    $order = Order::findOrFail($orderId);
    
    // Generate invoice from order
    $invoice = $invoiceService->generateFromOrder($order);
    
    return "Invoice #{$invoice->number} created successfully!";
}
```

### Manually

You can also create an invoice manually:

```php
use Mavrickdeveloper\Ttpay\Models\Invoice;

$invoice = Invoice::create([
    'number' => 'INV-2025-001',
    'date' => now(),
    'due_date' => now()->addDays(30),
    'customer_name' => 'John Doe',
    'customer_email' => 'john.doe@example.com',
    'customer_address' => '123 Main St, City',
    'status' => 'draft',
    'total' => 100.00,
    'currency' => 'EUR',
    'notes' => 'Thank you for your business!',
]);

// Add invoice items
$invoice->items()->create([
    'description' => 'Service X',
    'quantity' => 1,
    'unit_price' => 100.00,
    'tax_rate' => 20,
]);
```

## PDF Invoice Generation

TTpay includes a service for generating PDF invoices:

```php
use Mavrickdeveloper\Ttpay\Services\InvoicePdfService;

public function generatePdf(InvoicePdfService $pdfService, $invoiceId)
{
    $invoice = Invoice::findOrFail($invoiceId);
    
    // Generate PDF
    $pdf = $pdfService->generate($invoice);
    
    // Return PDF for download
    return $pdf->download("invoice-{$invoice->number}.pdf");
    
    // Or stream it in the browser
    // return $pdf->stream("invoice-{$invoice->number}.pdf");
}
```

### PDF Customization

You can customize the PDF invoice template by publishing and modifying the view:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Mavrickdeveloper\Ttpay\TtpayServiceProvider" --tag="views"
```

The invoice template is located at:
```
resources/views/vendor/ttpay/invoice/pdf.blade.php
```

### Custom Fields

You can add custom fields to your invoice by extending the `Invoice` model:

```php
// app/Models/Invoice.php
namespace App\Models;

use Mavrickdeveloper\Ttpay\Models\Invoice as BaseInvoice;

class Invoice extends BaseInvoice
{
    protected $fillable = [
        // Include all the base fillable fields
        'number', 'date', 'due_date', 'customer_name', 'customer_email',
        'customer_address', 'status', 'total', 'currency', 'notes',
        // Add your custom fields
        'purchase_order_number', 'department',
    ];
}
```

## Invoice Service

The `InvoiceService` class provides various methods for working with invoices:

```php
use Mavrickdeveloper\Ttpay\Services\InvoiceService;

class InvoiceController
{
    protected $invoiceService;
    
    public function __construct(InvoiceService $invoiceService)
    {
        $this->invoiceService = $invoiceService;
    }
    
    public function generateFromOrder($orderId)
    {
        $order = Order::findOrFail($orderId);
        return $this->invoiceService->generateFromOrder($order);
    }
    
    public function send($invoiceId)
    {
        $invoice = Invoice::findOrFail($invoiceId);
        return $this->invoiceService->send($invoice);
    }
    
    public function markAsPaid($invoiceId)
    {
        $invoice = Invoice::findOrFail($invoiceId);
        return $this->invoiceService->markAsPaid($invoice);
    }
}
```

## Invoice Emails

TTpay can automatically send invoice emails to customers:

```php
use Mavrickdeveloper\Ttpay\Services\InvoiceService;

$invoiceService->send($invoice, [
    'subject' => 'Your Invoice #' . $invoice->number,
    'message' => 'Please find your invoice attached.',
    'cc' => ['accounting@example.com'],
]);
```

### Email Template

You can customize the invoice email template by publishing and modifying the view:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Mavrickdeveloper\Ttpay\TtpayServiceProvider" --tag="views"
```

The email template is located at:
```
resources/views/vendor/ttpay/invoice/email.blade.php
```

## Invoice Client

The `InvoiceClient` class provides methods for working with invoices programmatically:

```php
use Mavrickdeveloper\Ttpay\Clients\Invoices\InvoiceClient;

$invoiceClient = new InvoiceClient();

// Generate PDF
$pdf = $invoiceClient->generatePdf($invoice);

// Send invoice email
$invoiceClient->sendEmail($invoice, [
    'to' => 'customer@example.com',
    'subject' => 'Your Invoice',
    'message' => 'Please find your invoice attached.',
]);
```

## Managing Invoices with Filament

TTpay integrates with Filament to provide a comprehensive interface for managing invoices through the `InvoiceResource`:

```php
namespace Mavrickdeveloper\Ttpay\Filament\Resources;

use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Resources\Resource;
use Mavrickdeveloper\Ttpay\Models\Invoice;
use Mavrickdeveloper\Ttpay\Filament\Resources\InvoiceResource\Pages;

class InvoiceResource extends Resource
{
    protected static ?string $model = Invoice::class;
    protected static ?string $navigationIcon = 'heroicon-o-document-text';
    protected static ?string $navigationGroup = 'Finance';
    
    // Form and table configurations
}
```

The Filament interface allows you to:

1. Create and edit invoices
2. Generate PDF invoices
3. Send invoices via email
4. View invoice statuses
5. Mark invoices as paid
6. Convert invoices to e-invoices

## Conclusion

TTpay's invoicing system provides all the tools you need to create, manage, and distribute invoices in your Laravel application. Whether you're generating invoices from orders, sending them via email, or managing them through the Filament admin panel, TTpay makes it easy to handle your invoicing needs.
