# Payment Processing

The TTpay package provides robust payment processing capabilities using SEB payment gateway and other providers. This document explains how payment processing works and how to implement it in your application.

## Overview

TTpay's payment processing system is built around the following components:

1. **Payment Client**: Handles payment request creation and submission
2. **Callback Handler**: Processes payment notifications from providers
3. **Payment Form**: Generates and manages payment form presentation
4. **Status Service**: Checks and updates payment statuses

## Payment Flow

The typical payment flow in TTpay follows these steps:

1. **Create Order**: An order is created in your application
2. **Generate Invoice**: An invoice is created based on the order
3. **Initiate Payment**: Payment is initiated using the chosen payment method
4. **Process Callback**: The payment provider sends a callback with the payment result
5. **Update Status**: The payment status is updated in your application

## Using the Payment Client

The `PaymentClient` class handles communication with payment providers:

```php
use Mavrickdeveloper\Ttpay\Clients\Payment\PaymentClient;
use Mavrickdeveloper\Ttpay\Models\Invoice;

public function processPayment(Invoice $invoice, string $paymentMethod)
{
    $paymentClient = new PaymentClient();
    
    // Process the payment
    $paymentResponse = $paymentClient->processPayment(
        $invoice,
        $paymentMethod,
        [
            // Additional parameters specific to the payment method
        ]
    );
    
    // Handle the response
    if ($paymentResponse->isSuccessful()) {
        // Redirect to payment provider or show success message
        return redirect($paymentResponse->getRedirectUrl());
    } else {
        // Handle failure
        return back()->withErrors($paymentResponse->getErrorMessage());
    }
}
```

## Supported Payment Methods

TTpay supports various payment methods through SEB and other providers:

### Credit/Debit Cards

```php
$paymentResponse = $paymentClient->processPayment(
    $invoice,
    'card',
    [
        'return_url' => route('payment.return'),
        'cancel_url' => route('payment.cancel'),
    ]
);
```

### Bank Transfer

```php
$paymentResponse = $paymentClient->processPayment(
    $invoice,
    'bank_transfer',
    [
        'return_url' => route('payment.return'),
        'cancel_url' => route('payment.cancel'),
    ]
);
```

### Other Payment Methods

The package is designed to be extensible, allowing you to implement additional payment methods as needed.

## Payment Callbacks

Payment providers send callbacks to notify your application about payment status changes. TTpay handles these callbacks through the `PaymentCallbackController`:

```php
// routes/web.php
Route::group(['prefix' => 'payment'], function () {
    Route::get('/callback/{order_reference}', [PaymentCallbackController::class, 'handle'])
        ->name('payment.callback')
        ->withoutMiddleware([VerifyCsrfToken::class]);
});
```

The controller validates the callback request, updates the payment status, and performs necessary actions based on the payment result.

## Security Considerations

TTpay implements several security measures for payment processing:

1. **Request Validation**: All payment requests are validated before submission
2. **Nonce Validation**: Each callback is verified with a unique nonce to prevent replay attacks
3. **Signature Verification**: Callback signatures are verified to ensure authenticity
4. **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communication with payment providers uses HTTPS
5. **Order Reference Validation**: Order references are checked to ensure they match existing records

## Error Handling

TTpay provides comprehensive error handling for payment processing:

```php
try {
    $paymentResponse = $paymentClient->processPayment($invoice, $paymentMethod, $params);
    // Handle successful request
} catch (PaymentException $e) {
    // Handle payment-specific errors
    Log::error('Payment error: ' . $e->getMessage(), [
        'invoice_id' => $invoice->id,
        'payment_method' => $paymentMethod,
    ]);
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    // Handle general errors
    Log::error('General error during payment: ' . $e->getMessage());
}
```

## Logging

TTpay logs all payment-related activities:

1. **Payment Requests**: Details of all payment requests are logged
2. **Payment Responses**: Responses from payment providers are logged
3. **Callbacks**: All callback requests and their processing results are logged
4. **Errors**: Any errors that occur during payment processing are logged

## Testing Payments

TTpay includes a convenient SEB API tester for testing payment processing:

```
/seb-api-tester
```

This page allows you to:

1. Test payment creation and processing
2. View requests and responses
3. Simulate callbacks
4. Test different payment methods and scenarios

## Customizing Payment Processing

You can customize payment processing by:

1. **Extending the PaymentClient**: Create a custom client that extends the base PaymentClient
2. **Custom Callback Handlers**: Implement custom callback handling logic
3. **Event Listeners**: Listen for payment events and perform custom actions

## Conclusion

TTpay's payment processing system provides a robust, secure, and flexible way to handle payments in your Laravel application. By following the guidelines in this document, you can implement payment processing with confidence, knowing that your application is using best practices for security and error handling.
